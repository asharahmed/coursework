# SBI3U - SPECIATION - WED MAY 24TH
## Microevolution (9.1)
	* various factors cause changes within populations

## Macroevolution (9.2)
	* formation of a new species 
	* speciation
	* new species formed from existing species

## How do new species originate?
* Populations must become isolated
	* geographically isolated 
	* reproductively isolated
	* isolated populations evolve independently 

* 2 types of speciation
	* allopatric - geographically isolated population 

##  Sympatric Speciation
	* A single population divides into 2 reproductively isolated groups without geographic isolated
	* In flowering plants: can self-fertilize and cause chromosomal changes
		* reproductive barrier between offspring and parent generation
		* polyploidy: errors in cell division resulting in extra sets of chromosomes

## Rate of Speciation
	* Gradualism - gradual accumulation of small changes over a long time
	* Punctuated Equilibrium - rapid bursts of change mixed with long periods of little to no change

## Gradualism vs. Punctuated Equilibrium 
* Gradualism 
	* evolution occurs at a slow steady rate
	* small adaptive changes gradually accumulating over time in populations
	* Species originate through a gradual change of adaptations 
* Punctuated Equilibrium 
	* rapid bursts of change 
	* long periods of little or no change
	* species undergo rapid change when they 1st get isolated from main population
	* supported by fossil evidence

## Adaptive Radiation
* Type of allopatric speciation
* P366 Galapagos finches example
* Each species exhibits different traits with which they can exploit an ecological niche 
* Type of divergent evolution = species once similar to an ancestral species become increasingly distinct
* Convergent evolution = unrelated species live in similar environments in different parts of the world
* Share similar pressures of natural selection and may evolve similar traits independently
