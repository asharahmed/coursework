# SBI3U Evolution Test - Notes
## What is evolution?
The change of the genetic makeup of a population over time.

## What is Natural Selection?
Different success in reproduction of different phenotypes resulting from interaction of organisms with their environment

## Evidence of Evolution
1. Fossils (impressions of organisms from the past, mineralized. See SES4U notes). Cuvier invented palaeontology, the study of fossils.
2. Age of the Earth
3. Comparative Anatomy (Homologous, Analogous, Vestigial Structures
	* Homologous: Same origin, different function in different organisms
	* Analogous: Different origin, similar function 
	* Vestigial: Non functioning structures homologous to functioning structures in closely related organisms
4. Molecular Biology (common genetic code)
5. Radiometric Dating (using half-life to date samples)

## Ideas of Evolution
* HUTTON - Gradualism
* MALTHUS - Population growth is exponential, but not all individuals can survive, leading to only those that have beneficial mutations.
* Lamarack - Fossils => Evolution; Based a (incorrect) theory of evolution
* Lyell - Uniformitarianism = Geological processes still occur today
* Darwin - HMS Beagle, notebook on Origin of Species, adaptation (finches & their beaks)
* Wallace - Develops nearly identical theory to Darwin’s
* Darwin and Wallace - co-publish “The Origin of Species”:
	1. Organisms change gradually from their ancestors
	2. Natural selection determines the course of evolution based on:	
		1. The fossil record
		2. Homologous structures
		3. Domestic animals (artificial selection)
		4. Other work
* Mendel develops theory of inheritance with peas

## Darwin’s Theory of Evolution
 **Survival and Reproduction are NOT random**

His theory was based on 5 assumptions:

	1. Many more in a population are born than can survive

	2. Variation among individuals - not identical 

	3. Individuals with certain characteristics have a better chance of survival than others

	4. Some characteristics are heritable

	5.  Long periods of time (slow change)


Blending theory of inheritance was seen as a weakness to Darwin’s theory, but 6 years later Mendel would explain this

Altruism - Multiple individuals helping one individual reproduce: sisters helping one individual reproduce (family genetics is passed on). Considered a fatal part of Darwin’s theory

## Speciation - the formation of a new Species 
Evolution at a species level is known as “microevolution”

Species - members of a population that can breed with each other under natural conditions

Reproductive Isolating Mechanisms - Behavioural, Structural, and Biochemical traits preventing individuals of different species from reproducing successfully with each other

### Pre-Zygotic Mechanisms (prevent fertilization)
	1. Ecological
	2. Temporal
	3. Behavioral
	4. Mechanical
	5. Gametical
	
### Post-Zygotic Mechanisms
	1. Zygotic Mortality
	2. Hybrid Inviability
	3. Hybrid Infertility
	
### Modes of Speciation

Allopatric Speciation - different geography

Sympatric Speciation - same geography

Hardy-Weinberg Frequencies not maintained => evolution occurring

### Causes of Microevolution
	1. Genetic Drift 
	a) bottleneck effect
	b) founder effect
	2. Gene Flow
		* Loss/Gain of alleles by emigration and or immigration
		* Differences are reduced
		* Amalgamates local populations 
	3. Mutation
		* Changes in the gene pool of a population
		* Always occurring (mutations occur once every 50,000 to 100,000 duplications)
		* ORIGINAL SOURCE OF ALL VARIATION
		* neutral, beneficial, or harmful
		* beneficial ones lead to reproductive success => adaptation => evolution 
	4. Non-Random Mating
		* Inbreeding - For HW frequencies to hold, individuals of a population must choose partners at random. In reality, this is not the case, usually, individuals choose partners close. Closer neighbours = inbreeding
		* Assortative Mating - Individuals select partners that are like themselves in certain traits (i.e. beak length)
	5. Natural Selection  
		* Some variants leave more offspring than others = differential success in reproduction
	PATTERNS OF SELECTION:
		* 	 Mutations provide continuous supply of new genetic variation. Natural selection acts on phenotypes.
		1. STABILIZING SELECTION
		2. DIRECTIONAL SELECTION
		3. DISRUPTIVE SELECTION
		4. SEXUAL SELECTION
		5. CUMULATIVE SELECTION
