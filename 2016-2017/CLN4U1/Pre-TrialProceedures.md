# PRE TRIAL PROCEEDURES

## The Crime Scene

 * Police have the right to cordon off the crime scene to make sure no evidence is lost or tampered with
 * Police can refuse entry to a crime scene
 * HOWEVER, if the incident involves a death, the **coroner** has jurisdiction over the area.
 * The area will be photographed and searched for items such as hair or fibre samples, blood, forced entry, physical struggle, fingerprints, footprints or weapons.
 	* This is called forensic evidence
